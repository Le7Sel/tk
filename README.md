#toying with Tkinter

*I have some experience with __Pygame__, but I would like to look at how __Tkinter__ works.*

This is what I hope to learn:
* Opening a window
* Displaying text on screen
* Rendering simple shapes
* Rendering Images
* Making the window interactive
    * Keyboard
    * Mouse
* Change how the window is displayed

This is what I learned so far:
1. Opening a window
1. Display plain text on screen
1. Change how the window is displayed
